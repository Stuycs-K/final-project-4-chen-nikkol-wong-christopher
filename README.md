### Project Description: 
For our project, we plan to recreate Minesweeper in Processing. Left-clicking will explore a square, either excavating the square or finding a mine and ending the game. If the cell has no mines as neighbors, it recursively explores said neighboring cells. Right-clicking places flags to mark potential mines, preventing those squares from being left-clicked. The flag can be removed by right-clicking again. 

The mines are initialized at first click, preventing the user from starting on a mine. All mines are revealed upon losing, as well as any false flags. We also added settings to toggle the board size and the number of mines and a counter to show the number of unflagged mines remaining.

### Directions: 
- No additional steps to compile or run project

- Left-click explores cells
- Right-click places and removes flags

- Settings button opens and closes settings menu
- Sliding handles in settings menu changes board size and number of mines
- Apply button in settings menu applies settings from handles

- Space key resets board
- Left-click resets board when game ends after winning or losing
- H key hides win/lose message to see board after game ends

- No major bugs to avoid (to our knowledge)
